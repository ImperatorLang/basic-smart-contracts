# Smart contracts

This repository is dedicated to all things regarding Cardano smart contract development.

## CENT - a first cohort "Plutus Pioneer"
Our lead developer graduated with the first cohort of the great course **Plutus Pioneer Program** by IOG (Input Output Global) April - June 2021. You can read more about this in the repository https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus-pioneer-program
This repository contains a collection of smart contract related resources created in our own development. The resources are targeted to be reusable components for you to customize to your own needs or to use as basis for your own smart contracts.


## The site is a work in progress
It was created March 2022 and was made publicly available to you in April when the basic content had been created. New and more advanced resources will be added to the site, so make sure to come back from time to time.

The objective of the site is not to be a course you follow from Lecture 1 until Lecture X. The components of this site is meant to be as self containing as possible. If a component depends on other components we list these dependencies in the topic brief.
